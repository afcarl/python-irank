A collection of tools for managing music ratings.

Here's a brief description of the most common commands:
(assuming you have run `0alias irank http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/irank.xml`)
-----
irank edit <filename>:   Edit the ratings assigned to a file.

irank rhythmbox:         Monitor rhytmbox for changes, and allow editing of
                         the current track.

irank playlists:         Generate playlist folders in the configured "irank" directory,
                         where each playlist is a folder of that name containing symlinks
                         to the real location of all matched tracks (these are all the
                         files within the configured "music" directory).

irank rating-sync:       Used with the android app, to apply modified ratings
                         to the original files.



Various configuration files are used to tell irank what
music to index and where to put its results, here's an
example of mine:


~/.config/irank/paths: (where to find things, in yaml key/value format)
-----
music: ~/Music/Library
irank: ~/Music/irank
android: /media/DESIRE/MP3


~/.config/irank/ratings: (a list of the crieria you want to use to rate songs)
-----
rating
Mood
Pop
Softness
Hardcore
Nostalgia


~/.config/irank/playlists (yaml file, where the values are in the form of sqlite conditions)
-----
angry: rating>2 and Mood<3 and Hardcore>0 and Pop<3
car: rating>2 and Pop>2 and Hardcore<2 and Mood>3
fun: rating>2 and Mood>3 and Hardcore<3 and Softness<4
soft: rating>1 and Softness>2 and Mood>2 and Pop<5
new: datetime(updated_at, 'unixepoch') > datetime('NOW', 'localtime', '-4 months') and rating > 0
new_good: datetime(updated_at, 'unixepoch') > datetime('NOW', 'localtime', '-4 months') and rating > 3



Metadata is stored inside the comment field of the file, in the form "[key=value]". I
have changed operating systems and music players a handful of times since origininally
writing irank, and this is the best way to keep them portable that I know of.
